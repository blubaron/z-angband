exceptions:

 * Adam Bolt's (16x16) graphics may be redistributed and used for any purpose, 
   with or without modification.

 * David Gervais' (32x32) graphics may be redistributed, modified, and used
   only under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence:

 * the sounds are freeware, whatever that means.

 * The font files are all by Leon Marrick and/or Sheldon Simms III and/or Nick
   McConnell, all of whom have agreed to their Angband work being released
   under the GPL.

 * The SDL runtime libraries (if provided with your copy of the game) are under
   the following licence:

     The Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL for short) is a cross-platfrom library
     designed to make it easy to write multi-media software, such as games and
     emulators.

     The Simple DirectMedia Layer library source code is available from:
     http://www.libsdl.org/

     This library is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPL license:
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html

It is considered good practice to retain this statement for derivatives, rather
than (e.g.) redistributing Adam Bolt's tiles under the GPL, or choosing to make
a variant which is only under one of the Angband or GPL licences.  This allows
easier sharing of changes between variants.

***** <AndroidIOSLicense>

The Android and Apple IOS platform code is licensed under a
noncommercial license, with terms prohibiting any direct charges,
pop-up advertisments and distributing behind so called "pay walls",
but specifically allowing distributing from sites that may have
advertising in them, even if the sites make extra money from the
advertising.  Distribtion from stores like Goggle Play store, Apple
iTunes, Windows Store, and Amazon are specifically allowed. (as long
as there is no charge for the download/access.) Optional in-game
micro-transactions may also be specifically allowed, if those
transactions do not give any significant advantage in winning the
game (ie not "Pay-to-win"). (any game advantange gained from a
micro-transaction, must be able to be obtained by a player who did
not use a micro-transaction, even if it is harder or takes a lot more
time.) 

Any remade package may not use the original package name.
The program/package must use the minimum amount and type of
permissions appropriate for the user-visible game play (no tracking
or statistics only permissions)
